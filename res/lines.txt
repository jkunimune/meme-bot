Did you speak? I thought 'twas the braying of an ass.
Not even otyughs would dine on this.
Am I to make pie from these crumbs?
Are you the lord here? I bring dark tidings from afar.
You would make a mistress of the moon, if it shone on you.
You have lit my lantern wick, that's for sure! I am aflame.
You! Fetch my steed!
'Tis said that in Veluna they eat such things.
Careful, whelp. Far greater than thou hath perished for less.
Hold onto thy seat. This trail has more bumps to come!
I feel I have inherited much from this meeting.
Stop saying that! Are you a fool?
You dare speak of this, rascal?
On the contrary, I acknowledge all your faults.
My liege, he's dead.
It seems we are in a bit of a pickle.
No, master! He turned to stone.
But I am your son!
Murder! Oh, murder!
Hurts, doesn't it?
This portends an unpleasant day.
What manner of ghoul is this I see before me?
Knaves, footpads, and liars. I am in good company!
Even a beholder wouldn't have seen that one coming!
Hurry! 'Tis best I die quickly.
Lend me your hand. There is something I must show you.
I would not wish you upon a toad.
You beastly little imp!
Oh, let us make merry again soon!
Night comes, and we must away!
I smell a foul wind.
Tomorrow should dawn merrier.
My hope is shriveled like a grape. Let us make wine of it!
Tell me what I must do.
Speak only good news! My mood is leaden.
I think I'll hide in the chimney.
Enough! I shall not be kicked by any mule!
An unnecessary footnote, you are.
I would tear the world in two for a quaff.
How now, friend. Why the long face?
I shall make a banquet of your dreams.
Hush, my sweet dumpling.
We danced too long; now all the music is gone.
Such humor. I can barely hold my sides.
Who goes there, on this woebegone, rain-lashed night?
The words catch in my throat. I cannot speak them!
That is a goatish look you have upon your face.
Is that a hoot or a growl? It chills my blood!
A tailor could not sew a finer lie.
Silence, piglet! You have squealed enough.
This dream shall soon end.
As for this one: let your sword speak.
A runt has no place among giants.
Perhaps I shall have that drink, after all.
Awake! The time is upon us.
Strange bedfellows, these ones.
I have a wicked thought, if you will hear it.
Well, here is a serpent!
Two truths told. A lie is sure to follow.
I warn you: my patience has sunk.
It seems I am betrayed.
Have you met my husband?
Bar the door! They're here!
Let me answer this one.
From this wound I shall not recover. You have slain me.
Let us dance in the whistling wind!
I shall not rest 'til the deed is done.
My enemies are dead, yet I hunger still.
This is no night for joy.
See, 'twas I all along!
Here's some gristle to chew upon.
I feel like a giant stepped on my head.
All is lost! No prayer can save us now!
Oh, for a sword!
What malice are you planning?
What fresh horror is this?
Something stirs below.
See! I blush red as a radish.
This truly is the worst outcome.
Tomorrow, at sunrise, I shall no longer be here.
What did you just fucking say about me you little bitch?
I was eating those beans.
Murder, did you say?
How cute.
The way I see it, the lad's got antitil sunset.
Art thou feeling it now, sir?
My leg!
Who are you peopleâ€½
Verily, the inner machinations of my mind are an enigma.
They are dead. Every single one of them. Not just the men.
We shall build a moat!
I don't need it.
He was number one!
Art thou ready to party?
