I just wanted to see what would happen if I did this.
I was eating those beans.
Are you fucking insane?
I was _eating those BEANS_!

Rupert!
You have to stay determined!
You can't give up...
You are the future of humans and monsters...
Rupert!

What would you rather do?
Do absolutely noting!

He doesn't like you.
I don't like you either.
You'd better watch yourself.
We're wanted men.
I've got the death sentence in twelve systems.
I'll be careful.
You'll be dead!
This little one's not worth your trouble. Now here, let me buy you something.

all right.
well here's a better question.
do you wanna have a bad time?
'cause if you take another step forward...
you are _really_ not going to like what happens next.
welp.
sorry, old lady.
this is why i never make promises.
it's a beautiful day outside.
birds are singing...
flowers are blooming...
on days like these...
kids like you...
SHOULD BE BURNING IN HELL.
Danana na. Na na na nanana.

A strange light fills the room.
Sunlight is filtering through the barrier.
It seems your journey is finally at an end.
You are filled with DETEMMIENATION.

Seven.
Seven human souls, and King ASGORE will become a god.
Six.
That's how many we have collected thus far.
Understand?

/^understand$/
Through your seventh and final soul, this world will be transformed.
First, however, as is customary for those who make it this far...
I shall tell you the tragic tale of our people.
It all started, long ago...
No, you know what?
SCREW IT!
WHY SHOULD I TELL THAT STORY WHEN YOU'RE ABOUT TO DIE!?!
NGAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!
YOU!
You're standing in the way of everybody's hopes and dreams!
Alphys' history books made me think humans were cool, with their giant robots and flowery swordsman.
BUT YOU?
You're just a coward!
Hiding behind that kid so you could run away from me again!
And let's not forget your wimpy goody-two-shoes-shtick!
Oooh! I'm making such a difference by hugging random strangers!
You know what would be more valuable to everyone?
IF YOU WERE DEAD!!!
That's right, human!
You continued existence is a crime!
Right now, I can feel everyone's hearts pounding together!
Step forward when you're ready!
Fuhuhuhu!
That's it, then...!
No more running away!
HERE I COME!!!!!!!!
En guarde!

Holy guacamole!

I don't
fuck with _you_!
You little stupidass bitch,
I ain't fuckin' with _you_!
I got a million billion things I'd rather fuckin' do.
Than be fuckin' with you.

goddamn it yumbo
What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch?
I'll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Navy Seals,
and I've been involved in numerous secret raids on Al-Quaeda,
and I have over 300 confirmed kills.
I am trained in gorilla warfare and I'm the top sniper in the entire US armed forces.
You are nothing to me but just another target.
I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words.
You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet?
Think again, fucker.
As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot.
The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life.
You're fucking dead, kid.
I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that's just with my bare hands.
Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit.
If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little 'clever' comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue.
But you couldn't, you didn't, and now you're paying the price, you goddamn idiot.
I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it.
You're fucking dead, kiddo.

How shall I do it?
Oh, I know.
I'll turn him into a flea,
a harmless, little flea,
and then I'll put that flea in a box,
and then I'll put that box inside of another box,
and then I'll mail that box to myself,
and when it arrives...
I'll smash it with a hammer!
It's brilliant, brilliant, brilliant, I tell you!
Genius, I say!
Or, to save on postage, I'll just poison him with this.

Mobius strip.
Inverted, please.
Give me that eigenvalue,
Model rendered.

We should take Bikini Bottom,
and push it somewhere else!
That idea might just be crazy enough... TO GET US ALL KILLED!

I killed them all.
They're dead.
Every single one of them.
Not just the men...
but the _women_!
and the _children_!
They're like animals, so I _slaughtered_ them like _animals_.
I HATE THEM!

all of them.
Not just the men.

it's over
I have the high ground.

You're stupid.
Your mom is stupid.
Your butt is stupid.
Your life is stupid.
